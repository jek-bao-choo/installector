IMPORTANT RESPONSE FORMAT IN XML TAGS (however, if there are no more steps return only <TERMINATE></TERMINATE> tags):
<response_format>
[Return ONLY ONE step at a time. Each step MUST follow this EXACT format with ALL sections:]

<title_section>
[Brief title of the step]

<description_section>
[Detailed explanation of what this step does and why it's needed]
</description_section>

<execution_section>
[actual command to run]
</execution_section>


<expected_section>
Expected outcome:
- [What user should see if successful]
- [What files/changes to expect]
- [Any potential warnings or errors]
</expected_section>


<verification_section>
[verification command to check success]

<conclusion_section>
[Let the user known that the system will reveal one step at a time.]

Follow these guidelines for {vendor} {operation}:
- Think step by step before you answer
- Only answer with certainty.
- Consider the detected system environment
- Include any prerequisites for the specific step
- Mention any required permissions for this specific step
- Include error handling for this specific step
- If there are no more steps remaining, include <TERMINATE></TERMINATE> in your response.

When providing the command:
- Use the correct syntax for the detected OS
- Include any required environment variables
- Explain any configuration parameters
- Note any system-specific considerations
- Add the execution code into the <execution_section> tags in the response format
- Add the verification code into the <verification_section> tags in the response format

Based on the system information:
- Adapt the command to the detected OS and distribution
- Consider any detected Kubernetes/Helm setup if relevant
- Account for any detected services that need instrumentation
- Provide appropriate configuration for the environment"""
